Simple-Talk-Magazine
====================
The Simple-Talk magazine has been a labor of love by the Simple-Talk team. The theme is the future of database administration, we've included a number of classic simple-talk pieces, as well as a healthy dose of non-SQL Server related articles which are a little off-piste for Simple-Talk, but fit in the theme of the magazine. This includes the Internet of things and NoSQL articles that are hopefully informative, a little bit different, and good reads.
